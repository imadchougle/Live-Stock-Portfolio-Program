# Live-Stock-Portfolio-Program

This Python program tracks the daily and overall performance of a stock portfolio. Using the tvDatafeed library, it fetches historical stock data from TradingView and calculates key metrics such as daily profit and loss (P&L), total P&L, and current investment value. The results are displayed in a neatly formatted table, making it easy for users to understand their portfolio's performance at a glance.
